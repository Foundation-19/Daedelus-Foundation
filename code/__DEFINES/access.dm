/*
	ID Trim access is a pre-set [\code\datums\id_trim\jobs.dm] group
	of accesses that can be toggled on and off at a ID managment
	computer.

	Wildcards are access that can be applied to your ID, outside of
	your ID's trim. (In order to give Security Access to a Logistics
	Technican, you need to give them a Wildcard.)

	Wildcards are limited, and based on your ID type. White/Grey
	IDs will allow you to select less wildcards then Silver/Gold ones.

	[\code\game\objects\items\cards_ids.dm] Here you can see the IDs
	and what Wildcard Level they use.

	[code\__DEFINES\id_cards.dm] Here you can see what limits each
	Wildcard Level has.
